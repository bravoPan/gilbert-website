<!-- I am currently a research intern at , supervised by , . One of my most recent tasks is developing a web based application to implement the text selection in Microsoft HoloLens which is controlled by the smart phone. -->


<!-- I am currently a research assistant from the team of Prof.[Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/) at Rutgers University, supervised by Dr.[Yu Yang](https://www.yyang.site/). One of my recent research is using transparent data to locate the food delivery carrier under the indoor scenario.


I have several research experiences which are concentrated on Machine Learning, Natural Language processing(Chinese mostly), HCI(application for VR/AR devices, proficient in web), Distributed System(model designing and model checking), Computer Network(network programming), algorithm(interested in dynamic programming and recurrence problems).

Recently I am wishing for a machine learning research opportunity, it is expected in the fields of economics/marketing/real application. -->

<!-- Hi there! I am currently a senior computer science student at Rutgers University. I have a few research intern experiences. One of my recent research project is to work as the research intern using transparent data to locate the food delivery carrier under the indoor scenario.

My research experiences are concentrated on developing software application, using data science to solve real problem, also natural language processing in Chinese context, developing Human Computer Interaction web application for VR/AR devices, model designing and model checking for distributed system.

, for example, the one I did is using the Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm to implement a swipe keyboard on an iPhone browser.
I am expected to graduate in May 2021, currently preparing for applying graduate education. -->

Hi there! I (Gilbert) am a CS master student at Columbia University@SEAS. I had my internship at Citrix System Inc as a software development engineer, I developed a repository server for company internal usage and improved the security. I also had several on-campus research experience on the aspect  of developing algorithm-based applications for testing the novel human-computer interaction. But my favoriate field is still the sfotware development. Top 3 favoriate languages in my ares is: Python, Golang, C++.

With respect to my personality, I'm always passionate about learning new tech stacks; and I have my open source spirit, I'm member of the Coala Development Group on Github. Besides, I'm super down-to-earth and a great team player.

<!-- I am currently actively seeking for **2022 SDE Summer Internship** job opportunities, please contact my email (the icon under my avatar) if you think any my experience interesting and fits. Thank you! -->
