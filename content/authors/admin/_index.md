<!-- I am currently a research intern at , supervised by , . One of my most recent tasks is developing a web based application to implement the text selection in Microsoft HoloLens which is controlled by the smart phone. -->


I am currently a research assistant from the team of Prof.[Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/) at Rutgers University, supervised by Dr.[Yu Yang](https://www.yyang.site/). One of my recent research is using transparent data to locate the food delivery carrier under the indoor scenario.


I have several research experiences which are concentrated on Machine Learning, Natural Language processing(Chinese mostly), HCI(application for VR/AR devices, proficient in web), Distributed System(model designing and model checking), Computer Network(network programming), algorithm(interested in dynamic programming and recurrence problems).

Recently I am wishing for a machine learning research opportunity, it is expected in the fields of economics/marketing/real application.
